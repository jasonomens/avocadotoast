                <p>I made placeholder pages for two of the four pages.  I picked a color palette
                that I felt would go well with the idea of the project. There is no content yet
                other than a sample picture to test relative positioning with. The nav menu took
                some time to figure out because I had a percentage wrong. I also spent way too
                much time figuring out the emojis in the footer. Little things like that made me
                spend significantly more time than I thought I would need. Will plan better next time.</p>

                <p>Most of the time spent on V2 was building the table. I added a repeating background, restructured
                the About page to use flexboxes, changed the body style to min-width 481px and put in new @media
                queries for phones and bigger screens on PCs. The mobile version of the nav menu has a navicon with a
                dropdown menu. I again underestimated the required time, which this time was mainly spent constructing the
                table.  I also struggled with the map, which ended up being a typo.</p>

            <p>Removed list from Home page and replaced with text and photos I took explaining why I picked this topic.
               I was able to make the text and images only take up a percentage of the available body width while still being centered.
               Updated Avocado Toast Lore page with new info and removed figure with mapped image. Created form and put media on the same page.
               Additional sources added to the bottom of the About page.
