                <p>I made placeholder pages for two of the four pages.  I picked a color palette
                that I felt would go well with the idea of the project. There is no content yet
                other than a sample picture to test relative positioning with. The nav menu took
                some time to figure out because I had a percentage wrong. I also spent way too
                much time figuring out the emojis in the footer. Little things like that made me
                spend significantly more time than I thought I would need. Will plan better next time.</p>

                <p>Most of the time spent on V2 was building the table. I added a repeating background, restructured
                the About page to use flexboxes, changed the body style to min-width 481px and put in new @media
                queries for phones and bigger screens on PCs. The mobile version of the nav menu has a navicon with a
                dropdown menu. I again underestimated the required time, which this time was mainly spent constructing the
                table.  I also struggled with the map, which ended up being a typo.</p>
